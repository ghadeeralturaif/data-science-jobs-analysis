# data-science-jobs-analysis

This work is part of as the requirement for completion of the Google Data Analytics Certificate through Coursera. This is my final capstone project in the course. In this case study, I will be using the R programming language for data analysis and visualization. I will use dataset downloaded on Kaggle to analyze data science job and  to get a better look insight of the salary and employment status of data science job over of many countries.

# Data science jobs analysis dataset
The dataset includes the following columns: <br />
1.work_year: The year the salary was paid. <br />
2.experience_level was divided as follows: <br />
    EN: Entry Level <br />
    MI: Mid Level <br />
    SE: Senior Level <br />
    EX: Executive Level <br />
 3.employment_types column was divided as follows: <br />
    FT: Full Time <br />
    PT: Part Time <br />
    CT: Contract basis <br />
    FL: Freelancer <br />
 4.company_size  column was divided as follows: <br />
    S: Small <br />
    M: Medium <br />
    L: Large <br />
job_title: The role worked in during the year. <br />
salary: The total gross salary amount paid. <br />
salary_currency: The currency of the salary paid. <br />

remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely. <br />
company_location: The country of the employer's main office or contracting branch. <br />
# Process, Analysis and Share
You can look at preprocessing, analysis, visualizations and key findings,  I made in the R programming language in the Case_study_3.ipynb file through Google colab.
# Act
### Conclusions:
1. The top five pouplar job titles in the Data Science field are Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer and Analytics Engineer. <br />
2. Most Data Science jobs require Mid-level/Senior-level/Expert experience level and the highest salaries for these experience level. <br />
3.  A significant increase of the number of Data Science jobs and the salary during 2022- and 2023 years. <br />
4.  Medium and Large companies size are pay the highest salaries in contrast to small size of companies. <br />
5.  A full time employment is best and high salary.
